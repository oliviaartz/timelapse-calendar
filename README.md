# Timelapse Calendar

The compositor assembles the timelapse calendar video. It is currently a max patch. The recorder is a tiny NodeJS app. Just run `npm install` in the recorder folder and then `node recorder.js`

Before recording a timelapse in the compositor-images.maxpat you'll need to create an "export" folder in this project. *Note that this this is "export" singular. No "s".*
